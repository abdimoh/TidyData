The purpose of the R script run_analysis.R  is to clean a data set on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

You will find the codebook of the tidy data and the R script in the repo. The readme of the original data is Readme_old.txt and the codebook of the original data 
is features_info.txt
  

Here is what the  R script  run_analysis.R does:
 
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* improve names of the activities in the data set
* label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the data set of the preceding step.
