1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.improve names of the activities in the data set
4.label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the data set of the preceding step.
